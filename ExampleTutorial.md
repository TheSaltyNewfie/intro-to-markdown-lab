## 1. Creating the directory / Entering the directory
To create a folder and open it, you need to do the following commands:
```bash
mkdir directory #Only if you need to create the directory first!
cd directory
```
* **Directory**: The name of the folder you want to create / go into.

## 2. Creating the file
Once you have entered the directory, you can now make the file by doing the following:
``` bash
touch filename
```
* **Filename**: What you want to name your file.

Now you are ready to edit the file!

## 3. Editing a file
This part will differ from person to person, I use VS code, so I will explain how to open it in that application.
```bash
code filename
```
* **Filename**: The file you wish to edit.
> Tip: You can also use `.` instead of a file name to open the directory in VS code!
